# svelte-page

Simple setup of a template [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) App. 

To start, create a repository, clone locally, then run the following if starting completely from scratch.

```
mkdir app
cd app
npm init vite . -- --template svelte
npm install
npm run dev
```

Will also be prompted to provide an app name, just use the repo name.

Then go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view locally.
